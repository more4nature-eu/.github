The more4nature project endeavours to catalyse transformative change  related to zero pollution, biodiversity protection, and deforestation prevention by actively involving citizens and communities as key stakeholders in collaborative ECA initiatives. 

In order to be able to aggregate data from different sources, we need to guarantee three things: 

* the data are accessible via an API or downloadable, 
* the data provide observations of the same physical variable (has to have the same meaning), and 
* the data quality is understood (e.g. has been validated). 

In MoRe4nature, we aggregates the data in a common API (e.g. STA+). With the combination of CGD and other EO and official datasets we can run models in EOSC that provide results that describe the environmental situation that once synthesized become indications of its status and evolution of the environment.

Citizen Science data has several advantages versus other kinds of data such as 
official monitoring data: it contains local knowledge, it has some level of redundancy that can be used to improve its 
quality, provides additional and potentially different observations to official source, resulting in improved spatial 
and/or temporal resolution, and the data is mostly openly accessible. These characteristics provide an opportunity for 
using citizen science to complement official sources for compliance assurance.

Earth Observation, CGD and other sources will be deployed on the cloud to enable the collection, analysis, and visualization of geographic data and to 
combine, validate, analyse and extract information. Spatial analysis will be used to analyse the relationship between 
sensor data and other geographic data, such as land use, deforestation, population density, and proximity to pollution 
sources. This helps identify patterns and potential causes of environmental issues and to generate indicators 
Data semantics: The goal of semantics is to help machines understand data. Embedded semantics with the data offer significant 
advantages such as reasoning over data and dealing with heterogeneous data sources. 
  
Raw data is too detailed to be used in 
environmental compliance assurance. Instead, spatialized indicators will be derived from data for each of the Use 
Cases. Spatialized indicators will be generated following methodologies and datasets familiar to the applicable EU 
Agency for each domain (EEA, JRC) and ECMWF. For each of the Use Cases, spatialized indicators will be created 
based on the following development concepts: 
* smart interpolation of data points into surface information.
* Data completion using other freely available datasets and AI techniques 
* EO data correlation and temporal completion of data, based on data of the Copernicus Programme.
